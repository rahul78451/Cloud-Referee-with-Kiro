### Cloud Referee 🌫️ - Your Trusted Cloud Infrastructure Advisor 🤝

The Cloud Referee project aims to provide a comprehensive and unbiased recommendation system for cloud infrastructure services. With the increasing demand for cloud computing, choosing the right cloud provider can be a daunting task. Our project seeks to simplify this process by evaluating various cloud providers based on factors such as budget, workload, use case, and learning curve.

📖 Description
-------------
The Cloud Referee project is designed to assist individuals and organizations in selecting the most suitable cloud infrastructure for their specific needs. The project utilizes a combination of natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to analyze the user's input and provide personalized recommendations. The system takes into account various factors, including the user's budget, workload, use case, and learning curve, to evaluate the suitability of different cloud providers.

The Cloud Referee project consists of two primary components: a logic module and a web application. The logic module, implemented in the `logic.py` file, contains the core functionality of the project, including the `evaluate_clouds` function, which assesses the suitability of different cloud providers based on the user's input. The web application, built using Streamlit and implemented in the `app.py` file, provides a user-friendly interface for users to interact with the system and receive personalized recommendations.

The project's objective is to provide a reliable and unbiased recommendation system that helps users make informed decisions when selecting a cloud infrastructure provider. By leveraging the power of machine learning and natural language processing, the Cloud Referee project aims to simplify the cloud selection process and reduce the complexity associated with evaluating different cloud providers.

The Cloud Referee project has numerous potential applications, including:
* Helping small businesses and startups choose the right cloud provider for their needs
* Assisting large enterprises in evaluating and selecting cloud providers for their complex workloads
* Providing a reliable and unbiased recommendation system for cloud infrastructure services
* Simplifying the cloud selection process and reducing the complexity associated with evaluating different cloud providers
